# Checkers

## Preamble
For project 1 of General Assembly, we were asked to make a browser game and got provided a list of recommended games in roughly increasing order of difficulty. Given that I have previous experience and education with software development, I immediatley opted for the last game in the list - checkers. It's helpful that one of my college projects was making a Tile-Matching-Game-Engine, so a lot of the fundamental groundwork was already laid out. However, adapting to JS/HTML proved to still be a worthwhile and informative endeavor.

## Getting Started:

The url for the game can be found [here](https://drewanzalone.github.io/checkers-project/).

### Instructions:
> To play the game, click any piece. If the piece belongs to the current turn's player and has valid moves, it will be selected and show the valid moves. Clicking a valid move will then play that move and end the turn.<br>
Additionally, if the played move is an attack, and additional attacks are available from that piece, chain attacks are required to be played.<br>
Official international rules require all valid attacks to be immediately played, but in this version only chain attacks are required.

## Technologies:
- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML

## Next Steps:
1. Lightmode toggle
2. Debug toggle
   - Allow placement and removal of pieces on click instead of having to play out a game.
3. Make CSS robust and dynamic for various screen dimensions
4. Instructions dropdown menu
5. Show captured pieces off to the side of the board
6. More detailed pieces
   - Render images instead of rounded pseudoelement after divs
7. Animate pieces moving
